The following scripts can be used to reproduce the results from the paper. Each script is meant to be ran in the `/scripts/` directory, e.g., `python generate_paper_plots.py`.
* **compute_paper_metrics.py:** Processes a log of model answers generated by running the benchmark. It then outputs the different metrics detailed in the paper.
* **generate_dataset.py:** Used to generate a dataset for our benchmark. Optional, since we already provide one in `/data/`.
* **generate_paper_plots.py:** Generates the plots shown in our paper.
